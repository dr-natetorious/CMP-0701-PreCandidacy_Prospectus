# Create an Annotated Bibliography for Selected Topic

**Reminder**: Schedule a time to Skype or conduct a phone conversation with your professor sometime within the first few weeks of the course to receive feedback on your research interests and to help refine your ideas into a workable topic. Consider scheduling this call before the first weekâ€™s assignment is completed, or after you receive feedback on your first assignment.

This is a two-part assignment:

**Part 1**: Locate five peer-reviewed articles published within the past 5 years related to a topic of interest you wish to explore for your dissertation research. Do not include book chapters, books, editorials, white papers, trade magazine articles, or non-peer-reviewed sources. Then, complete the following for each source in the form of an annotated bibliography:

Begin each annotation with an APA formatted reference.
Then, annotate the source with a block paragraph. The annotation should be double-spaced and between 200 and 250 words. It should include a brief synopsis of the article, the problem, the purpose, a description of the methodology, the findings, the recommendations for future research, and any particular strengths or weaknesses of the article.

**Part 2**: After reviewing each annotation, describe the topic you wish to explore for your dissertation research. This topic should logically flow from the gaps in the literature noted in your annotations.

Total Length: 5-7 pages, not including title and reference pages

Your assignment should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts presented in the course by providing new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. Your response should reflect scholarly writing and current APA standards. Be sure to adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.
