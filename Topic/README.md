## WFH: Is VR New Solution (2021)

Roll, Shawn C. PhD; Lucas, Gale M. PhD; Becerik-Gerber, Burcin DDes Authors’ Response to “Work From Home (WFH) During COVID-19: Is Virtual Reality (VR) a New Solution to New Problems?”, Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine: October 2021 - Volume 63 - Issue 10 - p e757-e758 doi: 10.1097/JOM.0000000000002340. [WFH_VR.pdf](WFH_VR.pdf).

This article discusses the transition to a more permenant WFH situtation, and the challenges of with segmenting the office from residence. Potential solutions exist with VR and AR technologies that create different context.

## Building Robotics with RoboMaker (2018)

Develop, Test and Deploy Intelligent Robotics Applications with AWS RoboMaker. Open Source FOR You. November 2018. Accessed November 6, 2021. [EBSCO](https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=edsggo&AN=edsgcl.568304329&site=eds-live&scope=site). [Develop_Test_and_Deploy_Intell.pdf](Develop_Test_and_Deploy_Intell.pdf).

RoboMaker is a simulation service where developers build `Robot Operating System` bots that interact with a virtual world.  ROS is the most widely used open source robotics framework.  Additionally, ML and other AWS technology integrates with the RoboMaker -- making it ideal for bridging multiple topics from this program.

## ROS with Smart Garbage Bins (2020)

Cheong, W. S., Kamarulzaman, S. F., & Rahman, M. A. (2020). Implementation of Robot Operating System in Smart Garbage Bin Robot with Obstacle Avoidance System. 2020 Emerging Technology in Computing, Communication and Electronics (ETCCE), Computing, Communication and Electronics (ETCCE), 2020 Emerging Technology In, 1–6. https://doi.org/10.1109/ETCCE51779.2020.9350912. [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9350912). [ROS_with_SmartGarbageBins](ROS_with_SmartGarbageBins.pdf).

The authors create a smart garbage bin that detects its full and navigates to the sanitation endpoint (via GPS & Computer Vision). They use Ultrasounic waves to detect near-by objects and avoid running into to objects. This capability enables scaling out the bins to more places without requiring more humans.  In places like Malaysia that is a critical need to combat public litering.

> Robot Operating System (ROS) is an open-source, meta-operating system for a robot that acts as an operating system for provide services including hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.
