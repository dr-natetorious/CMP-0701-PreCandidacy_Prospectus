# Annotated Bibliographies

Doctoral students at this stage of the degree must employ robust strategies to be a critical reader of scholarly academic peer-reviewed psychological research. This week is designed to assist you to further refine your ability to read and produce critical, annotated bibliographies of scholarly, peer-reviewed research indicating a comprehensive understanding and an evaluation of validity, rather than simply developing a basic summary. 

An annotated bibliography is a critical literature synthesis tool for researchers who are curating resources related to a topic of interest. The annotated bibliography is the first step to a comprehensive literature review and provides an opportunity to identify gaps in existing scholarship to be used for future research. An annotated bibliography requires critical reading and summarizing of the findings of collected sources. 

Each annotation begins with an APA formatted reference and is followed by a summary of the source. The following questions can be used to craft the summary of the annotated sources:

- What was the purpose of this research?
- What was the problem the researcher(s) addressed?
- What are the research questions?
- What method and design were used in this research?
- What were the results of the research?
- What are the implications for future research?
