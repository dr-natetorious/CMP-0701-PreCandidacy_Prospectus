# The Problem Statement

The problem statement is one of the most important foundational elements of a dissertation. In the problem statement, a student documents an issue captured in the literature prompting the need for a solution. The research conducted serves as a solution or partial solution to the problem. While a problem is the focus of the dissertation, it is important the researcher does not already know the outcome of the study. In fact, a dissertation is a process of discovery for the researcher and for the academic community. The dissertation must result in some original contribution addressing the problem identified in the problem statement. It is important to note a lack of research alone is not a compelling problem as many things are not studied, but do not necessarily warrant research. 

As part of the dissertation process, you will develop a statement of the problem related to a computer science-related topic of interest. The statement of the problem must flow logically from a general introduction to a more specific indication of the research problem. Scholarly, peer-reviewed research is employed to support the identification of the presented problem, the importance of the crisis/issue, and the need to research the problem.

A problem statement includes three components: 

**1.** The researcher must indicate the specific problem in need of remediation with citations to the literature to show this is a recent and relevant issue; 

**2.** The researcher should indicate who is affected by this problem; and 

**3.** The researcher should conclude with a sentence or two that notes what will happen if the problem is not addressed.
