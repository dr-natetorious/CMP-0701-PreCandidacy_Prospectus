# Topic Selection, the Research Problem, Purpose, and Questions

Welcome to the Pre-Candidacy Prospectus course for Computer Science. During this course, you will begin the work of creating and compiling the foundational elements of your doctoral dissertation while working closely with a professor who will serve as a member of your dissertation committee once you advance to candidacy status.  

The dissertation is the capstone academic accomplishment in the career of a doctoral student. The dissertation written for a doctoral degree is a substantial, scholarly work conducted independently by a candidate under the guidance of faculty members comprising the Doctoral Dissertation Committee. 

The dissertation should summarize, analyze, and integrate scholarly research literature relevant to a problem or topic area of interest, present original research in an area related to the candidate’s program and specialization, and demonstrate how the research contributes to theoretical development within a particular area or addresses problem resolution through improved practice. 

According to the Council of Graduate Schools, the satisfactory completion of a doctoral dissertation:

1. Reveals a candidate’s ability to think critically and to analyze, interpret, integrate, and synthesize information
1. Demonstrates the candidate’s knowledge of the scholarly and scientific literature relating to the dissertation topic
1. Displays the candidate’s ability to accurately describe the research methods and procedures used
1. Shows the candidate is able to present results in a sequential and logical manner
1. Demonstrates a candidate’s ability to discuss fully and coherently the meaning and applicability of the dissertation study results.

## Theoretical vs. Applied Dissertations

Before beginning the challenging dissertation journey, it is important to differentiate between applied and theoretical dissertations. The key research design differences between an applied and a theoretical (PhD) dissertation is scope and significance. Both doctoral degrees require the stated research design to demonstrate scientific rigor; however, applied research focuses on the specific study context and contribution to practice for leaders and practitioners in the field of education, while theoretical research possesses theoretical implications that contribute to theory. 

An applied dissertation requires the practical application of scholarship (Nelson & Coorough, 1994; Wergin, 2011). The applied dissertation is expected to be practice-based and results in a product designed to produce appreciable improvements to a problem within the context of practice (e.g., an institution, an organization, an industry, or other contribution to practice-based leadership). Examples of an applied investigation may include a replication study, a case study, or a special project (e.g., the evaluation of a curriculum, training program, strategic planning, change initiative, or educational artifact). An applied dissertation does not need to influence the theories in the field, but typically responds to a practical problem or proposed innovation (Archibald, 2010). It is a research-based degree, but unlike the PhD, research is focused on applying research to the advancement of practice in the field (solving complex problems in practice) (Archibald, 2010; Corley & Giola, 2011; Huba, Shubb, & Shelley, 2006).

A PhD requires original ideas about a specialized topic, as well as a high degree of methodological/scientific rigor (Nelson & Coorough, 1994). Research results from the PhD contribute new knowledge, making a difference to the theoretical context of the given field of study.

Differentiating scholarly contributions of new knowledge between the theoretical and the applied dissertations includes two criteria: originality and utility.

## Originality

Originality is measured by assessing whether the knowledge derived in the research has the quality of being either incremental (appropriate for the applied degree) or revelatory (appropriate for the PhD). This means the research adds value in such a way it either advances our understanding of prevailing theory (incremental), or it allows something never seen before (revelatory).

## Utility

Utility means the research must generate knowledge of either "scientific value" or “practical value.” Scientific value (predominate measure for the PhD) advances conceptual rigor or enhances its potential for broad operationalization and testing. This means the scope of a project must be great enough to contribute to, extend, or facilitate the extension of theory. Practical value advances the ability to apply theory directly in education settings.

**Heads Up**: Schedule a time to Skype or conduct a phone conversation with your professor sometime within the first few weeks of the course to receive feedback on your research interests and to help refine your ideas into a workable topic. Consider scheduling this call before the first week’s assignment is completed, or after you receive feedback on your first assignment.
