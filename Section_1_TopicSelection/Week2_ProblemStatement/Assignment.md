# Compose a Problem Statement

For this assignment, create a problem statement. Your problem must come from a critical issue that must be addressed, otherwise negative consequences will occur or continue. Begin by locating several peer-reviewed articles from the past 5 years that support the problem you wish to address in your dissertation. These articles may be ones previously gathered for your annotated bibliography assignment or additional resources you select after receiving feedback on your topic from your course mentor.

In most cases, scholarly citations within the past 5 years are required to support the problem you will investigate. These articles may be the ones previously gathered for your annotated bibliography assignment or additional resources you select after receiving feedback on your topic from your course mentor.

Next, you should articulate a concise problem statement by following these steps:

1. Present the general issue grounded in the research literature that leads to the need for the study.
2. Clearly describe and document the problem prompting the study. Include appropriate published or relevant primary sources to document the existence of a problem worthy of PhD doctoral-level research. Be sure to consider the following: What perspective is represented? For example, is the problem an individual level problem, an organizational problem, an industry problem, or a social problem?
3. Consider the theories relevant to predict, explain, and understand the problem and the potential negative consequences to the field or stakeholders if the proposed research is never conducted.
4. Support your assignment with at least five scholarly resources. In addition to these specified resources, other appropriate scholarly resources, including older articles, may be included.
